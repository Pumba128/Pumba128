- 👋 Hi, I’m @Pumba128, but for unknown reasons people often call me Artur.
- 👀 I’m interested in backend programming and data science. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python. Investing all my intellectual resources to do so. So far? Satisfied. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: 1. Projects dedicated to fight earth pollution and global warming. 2. Projects dedicated to understanding genes and human genome. 
- 📫 How to reach me - you can reach me here, at GitHub.
